# Graphs polar charts from antenna data

If you only want to look at data from one .csv file, name it "data.csv" and place it in the res/ folder.

To compare a file against your "data.csv" file, place a second .csv file named "data2.csv" in the res/ folder.

NOTE: The Java graphs are uglier and cannot compare two at a time
